# Using Kubectl
It is `Kubernetes` command line interface. 

## Command Structure

`kubectl [command] [type] [name] [flags]`

* `command`: any operation to be performed
* `type`: resource type
* `name`: resource name
* `flags` : special options or modifiers that override default values.

## Imperative Commands
create, update and delete live objects directly:

* Operations specified as arguments or flags. ```kubectl run nginx --image nginx```
* No audit trail

## Imperative object configuration
The kubectl command specifies required operations, operational flags and at least one file name:

* The configuration file specified must contain a full definition of the objects in YAML or JSON format.
```kubectl create -f nginx.yaml```

* Configuration templates help replicate identical results.

### Declarative object configuration
It stores configuration data in files:
* Operations are identified by `Kubectl`, not the user
* works on directories or individual files

`kubectl apply -f nginx/`

* they define desired state
