# Python and Vectorization

Vectorization in Python refers to the process of performing operations on entire arrays or sequences of data at once, 
rather than looping over individual elements. This approach leverages low-level optimizations and parallelization, 
resulting in faster and more efficient code execution, especially when working with large datasets.

**Example**

```
import numpy as np

# Create two numpy arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

# Element-wise addition using vectorized operations
result = a + b

print(result)
```

`try to avoid for loops` in computations.
