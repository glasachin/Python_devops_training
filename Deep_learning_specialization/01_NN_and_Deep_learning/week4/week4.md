# Week 4

## Deep Neural Network

NN with more than 2 hidden layer is `deep neural network`. How deep network we want depends upon the application. 


## Building Blocks of Deep Neural Networks


## Parameters and Hyper parameters

`parameters`: w (weights), b (biases)

`Hyper-parameters`: learning rate, iterations, number of hidden layers, hidden units, choice of activation functions. There are several others based on the kind of network.

`hyeper-parameters` control the `parameters`.
