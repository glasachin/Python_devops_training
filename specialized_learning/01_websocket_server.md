# Websocket Server
WebSocket server allows you to establish `real-time`, `bidirectional communication` between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers. This capability makes them ideal for applications that require instant data exchange with minimal latency.  

## Production Deployment
1. Use Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy for WebSocket connections.
2. Use SSL/TLS for secure connections (wss://).
3. Consider frameworks like FastAPI, Django Channels, or Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket integrations with web applications.
