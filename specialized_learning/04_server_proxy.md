# Server, Web Server, Reverse Proxy 

**What is a Server?**

A server is a system (hardware or software) that provides services, resources, or data to other devices, known as clients, over a network. Servers can handle various types of tasks depending on their configuration, ranging from hosting websites to running applications, storing files, or managing databases.

**Types of Servers**

Servers come in many types, each tailored to specific functions:

Server Type|	Purpose
---|---
Web Server	|Hosts websites and delivers web content via HTTP/HTTPS.
Application Server|	Runs application logic for dynamic content generation.
Database Server	|Manages and provides access to databases.
File Server|	Stores and shares files over a network.
Email Server|	Handles email sending, receiving, and storage.
Proxy Server|	Acts as an intermediary for client-server communication (e.g., reverse proxy).
Game Server|	Hosts online multiplayer games.


## Web Server
A web server is a specific type of server designed to handle HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients, such as web browsers. It delivers web content, including static files like HTML, CSS, and images, or dynamically generated content (e.g., PHP, Python scripts).

When you type a URL into a browser, a web server processes that request and sends back the corresponding web page or resource.

### Key Functions of a Web Server
1. HTTP Request Handling:
    * Receives HTTP requests from clients.
    * Processes the request and sends back a response (e.g., a web page or error message).
2. Static Content Delivery:
    * Serves pre-existing files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos.
3. Dynamic Content Generation:
    * Collaborates with application servers or scripting engines (e.g., PHP, Python) to create dynamic content.
4. SSL/TLS Encryption:
    * Encrypts data to provide secure communication (HTTPS).
5. Logging:
    * Maintains access and error logs for analytics and debugging.

### Examples of Popular Web Servers
1. Apache HTTP Server:
2. Nginx:
3. Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services):
4. Caddy:
5. LiteSpeed:


## Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices (such as web browsers) and backend servers. It forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server and returns the server's response to the client. The client interacts with the reverse proxy as if it were the actual server.

### How Does a Reverse Proxy Work?
1. A client (e.g., a browser) sends a request to the reverse proxy instead of directly contacting the backend server.
2. The reverse proxy examines the request and decides which backend server should handle it (if multiple servers are used).
3. The reverse proxy forwards the request to the selected server.
4. The server processes the request and sends the response back to the reverse proxy.
5. The reverse proxy sends the response to the client.

### Why Use a Reverse Proxy?
1. Load Balancing: 
    * Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overloading a single server and improve performance.
    * Ensures high availability by redirecting traffic from failed servers to healthy ones.
2. Improved Security
    * Hides the backend servers' IP addresses, making it harder for attackers to target them directly.
    * Allows for the enforcement of security policies, such as SSL/TLS encryption, DDoS mitigation, and IP filtering.
3. Caching
    * Stores copies of frequently requested content (e.g., images, scripts, or HTML files) to reduce the load on backend servers and speed up responses.
4. SSL Termination
    * Handles SSL encryption and decryption on behalf of the backend servers, reducing their computational overhead.
    * Simplifies certificate management by centralizing it on the reverse proxy.
5. Centralized Logging and Monitoring
    * Acts as a single entry point for traffic, making it easier to log and monitor requests.
6. Path-Based or Host-Based Routing
    * Routes requests to specific backend servers based on the URL path or hostname.

`Example: /api requests go to one server, and /static requests go to another.`

### Reverse Proxy vs Forward Proxy
1. `Reverse Proxy`: Positioned between clients and servers to handle requests from clients to servers.
2. `Forward Proxy`: Positioned between clients and the internet, typically used to anonymize or control outbound client requests.

### Popular Reverse Proxy Servers
1. Nginx

2. Apache HTTP Server (with mod_proxy module)

3. HAProxy

4. Traefik

5. Caddy


## Difference between reverse proxy and werbserver
A `reverse proxy` and a `web server` serve different roles in web architecture, though they can sometimes overlap in functionality. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two:

Feature	|Web Server|	Reverse Proxy
---|---|---
Purpose	|Serves web content directly to clients.|	Forwards client requests to backend servers.
Position in Architecture|	Interfaces directly with clients.	|Sits between clients and backend servers.
Primary Functionality|	Serves static and dynamic content.|	Distributes traffic, handles SSL, caches content.
Content Handling|	Directly processes and serves content.	|Relays content processed by backend servers.
Load Balancing	|Not inherently designed for it.	|Built-in load balancing capabilities.
SSL Termination|	Can handle SSL/TLS connections.	|Often terminates SSL/TLS to offload backend servers.
Caching|	Limited (varies by software).|	Built-in caching features.
Use Case|	Hosting websites and applications.|	Managing traffic for multiple servers.
Examples|	Apache, Nginx, IIS, Caddy.|	Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, AWS Elastic Load Balancer.
